## About

I am from Switzerland and I work at the HEP-VD in Lausanne as a Network Engineer since 2018. As a proactive and pragmatic IT en- thusiast, I continually strive to expand my knowledge and capabilities. My innate curiosity drives me to pursue a part-time bachelor’s degree at the HES-SO of Neuchâtel while maintaining my professional res- ponsibilities. I also enjoy practicing all kinds of sports, reading books, and learning more about Java and Clojure.
