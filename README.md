## About

I am from Switzerland and I work at the HEP-VD in Lausanne as a System and Network Engineer since 2018. My innate curiosity drives me to pursue a part-time bachelor’s degree at the HES-SO of Neuchâtel while maintaining my professional responsibilities. I also enjoy practicing all kinds of sports, reading books, and learning more about Java and Clojure.
